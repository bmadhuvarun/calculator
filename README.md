# calculator
**Introduction**
The Calculator Project is a web-based application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a simple yet functional user interface for performing basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The project helps users understand fundamental JavaScript logic and DOM manipulation.

**Features**
User-Friendly Interface: A responsive and visually appealing design.
Basic Arithmetic Operations: Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
Real-Time Display: Shows user input and results dynamically.
Clear Function: Allows users to reset calculations.
Keyboard Support: Users can enter numbers and operations via keyboard input.
Error Handling: Prevents invalid operations such as division by zero.
**Technology Stack**
HTML: Provides the structure for buttons and display screen.
CSS: Enhances UI with styling, colors, and layout responsiveness.
JavaScript: Implements logic for handling calculations and updating the display.
How It Works
The user clicks on number buttons to input values.
Operators (+, -, *, /) are used to perform calculations.
Pressing the "=" button evaluates the expression and displays the result.
The "C" button clears the screen for a new calculation.
**Future Enhancements**
Implement advanced functions like square root, percentage, and exponentiation.
Add a dark mode for better user experience.
Include history tracking to review past calculations.
Improve styling with animations for button clicks.
This Calculator Project is a great way to learn JavaScript event handling, mathematical operations, and UI/UX design while building an interactive web application. ðŸš€
